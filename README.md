### 🌌 The Mission

**Galaxy Mind** turns boring cognitive tests into an exciting journey across the universe. By helping our alien friends, children perform tasks that measure:
* 🛑 **Inhibition Control:** Assessing impulsivity (Go/No-Go tasks).
* 🧠 **Working Memory:** Testing recall capabilities.
* 📊 **Progress Tracking:** Real-time data visualization for parents/therapists.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack & Features

* **Frontend Core:** React 18 + Vite (Blazing fast build times).
* **Animations:** `framer-motion` for complex gesture-based interactions and page transitions.
* **Data Viz:** `recharts` for displaying the child's progress over time.
* **Styling:** Custom CSS with a responsive Space Theme.

### 🎮 The Games
1.  **GameInhibition:** A "Whac-A-Mole" style game where the child must click only specific aliens while avoiding others to test reaction time and impulse control.
2.  **RecallThemAll:** A sequence memory game requiring the child to repeat growing patterns of alien appearances.
